# options_pricer

This project is an initial implementation of the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method for pricing American-style options.

The current focus is on building a fast, accurate C++ backend to simulate option payoffs and exercise strategies using the Longstaff-Schwartz method with automatic algorithmic differentiation (AAD).

Eventually, this will grow into a full-stack, comprehensive financial simulation and pricing library. 

More updates coming soon.
